# Chat Room (React)

An example of using Qubit with React (and Vite) to build a simple live chat room with websockets.

## Local Development

1. Enable corepack with `corepack enable` if not enabled
1. Install dependencies with `pnpm i`
2. Run `pnpm dev` to run the Rust API and Vite frontend together
